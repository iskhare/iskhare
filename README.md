👋 Hi, I’m @iskhare

👀 I’m interested in systems, machine learning, and building research tools that scale — especially for education, science, and open-source communities.

🌱 I’m currently exploring how to push the limits of large language models, both through research (temporal reasoning, multimodal agents) and engineering (LLM infra, RL pipelines).

💞️ I’m always excited to collaborate on impactful projects — especially ones that intersect with research, reproducibility, or public-good infrastructure.
